I am a data-driven developer whom relies on compassion, logic & analysis to make sense of the world around me. For as long as I could remember, I've always had a special relationship with technology. After some self-teaching & successfully completing General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive, my perception of technology had totally shifted―programming revealed all the creativity and nuance that is involved in the development of our digital reality. ***something about projects here** I can create almost anything I desire or need; the only constraints lie in syntax. Bless Al Gore's internet. In previous roles, I was responsible for bringing order to chaos. I took on many challenges as though they were puzzles that needed to be solved. From xxx to xxx, **something about jobs here** I love programming because it allows me to embrace the most authentic version of myself―the self who is curious, thinking critically, learning, unlearning, researching, discovering, developing, & innovating. I'm searching for a team that values resourcefulness, intellectual curiosity and collaborating with individuals who are eager to share their knowledge with others.
