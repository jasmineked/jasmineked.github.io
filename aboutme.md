   <p>I am a data-driven developer whom relies on compassion, logic & analysis to make sense of the world around me. 
      For as long as I could remember, I've always had a special relationship with technology. After some self-teaching & successfully completing General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive, my perception of technology had totally shifted―programming revealed all the creativity and nuance that is required to develop our digital reality. There, we can create almost anything we desire; the only constraints lie in syntax. <strike>Bless Al Gore's internet.</strike>
      In previous roles, I was responsible for bringing order to chaos.From ****responsibility herre* to ***responsibility here** I took on many challenges as though they were puzzles that needed to be solved.</p>
      <p>Falling in love with programming was easy because it allows me to embrace the most authentic version of myself―the self who is curious, thinking critically, learning, unlearning, researching, discovering, developing, & innovating. My dream is to bring value to a team that also believes in resourcefulness, intellectual curiosity and collaborating with individuals who are eager to share their knowledge with others.</p>
